# ebay Price Tracking Analysis Project

# Description
To improve pricing strategies and increase sales for online selling business, I plan to create a tool that given a search term, returns
valuable insight about similar items being sold. I'm using web scraping and data analysis techniques in Python, using libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Numpy.
My vision is that this tool can be implemented on a web application, in which the user can input the product they're interested in, in this case, a baseball player, and
it'll present a series of graphs and other information. I also plan to implement price prediction model, similar to stock market analysis, but I haven't decided how and which model to use.

I am currently in the process of exploratory data analysis with a smaller dataset that I'll then generalize onto multiple of larger sizes. I finished the webscraping portion of the code, which also includes pagination. The dataset currently has link to product, sold date, sold price, and number of bids. I'm searching for a way to
include the starting price to compare with the selling price.
